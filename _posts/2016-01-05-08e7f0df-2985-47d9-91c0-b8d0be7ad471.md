As one of the leading English language voice over artists based in Switzerland, I provide powerful, professional narration, voice over and production services to clients who aim to communicate their message effectively and get results.

Drawing on more than 18 years of experience in the voice over business, I cater for commercials, documentaries, tourist guides, audio books, powerpoint or website presentations, audio trainers, voicemail, computer games, apps and more. 

Employing a wide variety of styles and top quality equipment at my home studio, I can also provide complete voice over production packages including scriptwriting services.

I have been employed by major corporations including Tissot, Nestl√©, Parker Pens and Novartis, as well as organisations such as the United Nations and International Red Cross. During my radio career I broadcast for the BBC, Capital Radio, Sky News, Edipresse Publications, World Radio Geneva and Radio Frontier.

I recently narrated "Roger McGowen, Death Row Inmate", winner of the 2014 prize for best documentary at the WilliFest International Film Festival in New York, and "Sequenced", a new virtual reality game by Apelab, and recipient of several international awards.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8d6930f8-7401-447c-9cd6-293d481f9b54.png)
